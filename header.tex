\subsection*{Abstract}

Cloud computing brings new levels of being connected, instead of the once disconnected 
PC-type systems. The proposal in this paper extends that level of connectedness in the cloud so that 
cloud service instances, hosted by providers, can relocate between clouds. This is key in order to 
provide economical and regulatory benefits but more importantly liberation and positive market disruption.

This paper demonstrates that one cloud service provider can connect with another and 
relocate service instances between each, at the command of the service owners. In the cloud world of 
competing cloud standards and software solutions, each only partially complete, the central research 
question which this paper intends to answer:
\noindent
\textbf{How to intrinsically enable and fully automate relocation of service instances between clouds?}
