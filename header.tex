\subsection*{Abstract}
Cloud computing is about bringing the users new levels of being connected, 
instead of the once disconnected PC type systems.  This proposal extends 
that level of connectedness in the cloud so that cloud services hosted by 
providers can relocate between clouds. This paper will demonstrate 
that one cloud service provider will be able to connect with another and 
relocate services between each at the command of the service owners.
In this world of competing cloud standards and software solutions, each 
partially complete, this paper central research question is:

\textbf{"How to intrinsically enable and fully automate relocation of services 
between clouds?"}
