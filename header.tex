\subsection*{Abstract}

Cloud computing is about bringing the users new levels of being connected, 
instead of the once disconnected PC type systems. The proposal in this paper extends 
that level of connectedness in the cloud so that cloud service instances 
hosted by providers can relocate between clouds. This paper will 
demonstrate that one cloud service provider will be able to connect with 
another and relocate service instances between each at the command of t
he service owners. In the cloud world of competing cloud standards and 
software solutions, each partially complete, the central research question which this paper intends to answer:

\textbf{How to intrinsically enable and fully automate relocation of service instances between clouds?}
