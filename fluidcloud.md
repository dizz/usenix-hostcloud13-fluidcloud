# Abstract #

Cloud computing is about bringing to users new levels of being connected, 
instead of the once disconnected PC type systems.  This proposal extends 
that level of connectedness in the cloud so that cloud services hosted by 
providers can relocate between clouds. The FluidCloud consortium will see 
that one cloud service provider will be able to connect with another and 
relocate services between each at the command of the service owners.
In this world of competing cloud standards and software solutions, each 
partially complete, this proposal√ïs central research question is:

"How to intrinsically enable and fully automate relocation of services 
between clouds?"

# Introduction #

*Describe the problem*
*State the contributions*

Today, cloud computing (Grance, 2011) services have little means to 
move from one cloud service provider to another. Standards are seen
to be the panacea, yet have little adoption by the market.

Having the ability for a cloud service to easily and seamlessly move 
from one provider to another will bring a huge competitive advantage
to any cloud computing service provider. It will have a huge advantage
to European cloud computing service providers. It will bring liberation
to cloud services, both the application and data. It will bring service 
movement rights to the cloud.

Cloud standards exist but are not adopted. Also, even the most relevant
standards are limited. Software that abstracts cloud computing to common
interfaces is more widely adopted. Yet for the services those standards or
software can manage, they do not contain any concepts to or mechanisms
of relocating those services. Ultimately, those cloud services remain locked
under the control of the hosting provider.
