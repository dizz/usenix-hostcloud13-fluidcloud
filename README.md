Cloud computing delivers new levels of being connected, instead of the once disconnected
PC-type systems. The proposal in this paper extends that level of connectedness in the cloud 
such that  cloud service instances, hosted by providers, can relocate between clouds. 

This is key in order to  provide economical and regulatory benefits but more importantly 
liberation and positive market disruption.  While service providers want to lock in their 
customer's services, FluidCloud wants the liberation of those and thereby allow the service 
owner to freely choose the best matching provider at any time. In the cloud world of  
competing cloud standards and software solutions, each only partially complete, the 
central research  question which this paper intends to answer: 

**How to 
intrinsically enable and fully automate relocation of service instances between clouds?**
